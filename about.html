        <h1>About Mohammad Labak</h1>
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>Hi, I'm Mohammad, a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Windsor with a passion for programming, technology, and innovation. With experience in software development, game design, and IoT, I'm on a mission to bring creative ideas to life through code.</p>
            
            <p>I've worked on a variety of projects, from creating a movement pack in Unreal Engine 5 to building a computer from scratch, programming a TA marking app, and contributing to my high school robotics team. My recent venture into creating maps for Unreal Editor for Fortnite includes a Fall Guys-inspired map, a first-person shooter, and an immersive horror game with a focus on audio design.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond projects, I have professional experience as a Teaching Assistant for an Introduction to Algorithms and Programming course, where I've honed my skills in mentoring, problem-solving, and communication. I also gained architectural design experience in high school, building a house under a licensed architect's guidance.</p>
            
            <p>I'm passionate about the CAN bus system and aspire to work in the automotive industry, particularly in IoT, with companies like Tesla. Looking ahead, I'm eager to specialize in artificial intelligence engineering, combining my software development expertise with my interests in machine learning and smart technologies.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, you'll find me exploring the world of electric vehicles, learning new tools and frameworks, or designing user-friendly software solutions. I'm always ready for the next challenge and look forward to creating impactful, innovative technology.</p>
